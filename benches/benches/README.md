# sv1 and sv2 clients benchmarks 
This repository contains code that benchmarks the performance of both the sv1 and sv2 clients using the `criterion` and `iai` library.

The benchmarking project aims to compare the performance of sv2 against sv1 and demonstrate the improvements of sv2 to increase its adoption. The benchmarks measure various aspects of the clients' performance, including connection time, subscription latency, share submission time, systems requirements such as RAM access, Instructions per cycle and more..
